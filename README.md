# Tetris in C++
This is my attempt to replicate the Tetris game in C++ and SFML library, without any game engines.

Video Demo is available [here](https://youtube.com/shorts/QR8kQUfsetk)

By building this game, I've learnt how to:
<ul>
<li>Create and navigate inside 2D game boards
<li>Handle Keyboard Inputs
<li>Work with Textures and Sprites
<li>Create separate game screens, track them as app level state, and update the screens accordingly - to give a feeling of end-to-end game experience
<li>Dynamically show game score
</ul>

I did replicate some parts the logic that allows creating different tetronimo shapes from the image texture. I've also used the images available on the internet, with the proper sizes that fit this C++ game well.

But the main effort was my own learning experience from scratch. For example, how to assemble the game pieces together, and other than just core mechanics, I have added checking of the Game End, checking lines completion and tracking the score, Welcome and Game Over screens.
